# hammer

Hammer is a distributed, ultra customizable load testing framework written in go. More details coming soon.

## Customization

The node and controller programs are default implementations of the framework, usable without needing to compile any code
The real power however comes in that you can build your own versions of these programs. Allowing incredible amounts
of flexibility. The documentation will be coming on how this can be done, and what options there are as the framework is
built out.
